<h1>iOS Game Control Scheme: How/why we ditched joystick controls for a swipe and tap system in an iOS platformer game.</h1>

<br>
<h2>The Problem:</h2>

<p>Joysticks and other forms of more traditional game input/controls (that developers were carrying over from previous game systems/platforms) are hard to use on mobile phones.</p>

<p>Why? Joysticks were originally made for physically touching/holding, and this does not translate well to pushing a finger around in a ~1"-in-diameter virtual image on a touchscreen. You just don't get the same feedback and precision. Also, when a players hands need to be held to the screen, that means their hands are covering the screen...that means the player can't see the screen. How do you play a game that you can't see?</p>

<p>To elaborate: controllers (as in, hand-held, traditional, physical video game controllers) like a D-pad with buttons or a joystick with buttons, are probably never appropriate for touchscreen input devices. <i>Inputs should be designed for the type of interactions users most naturally have (and/or have been standardized) for the device/platform one is developing for.</i></p>

<p>I first encountered joysticks on mobile devices while trying to play a first person shooter where the left joystick controlled strafing and the right joystick controlled vision (and shooting?! (I can't remember)). The controls made the game hard and it wasn't the kind of hard that I wanted to get good at. <i>My fingers would always move past the bounding boxes of the joysticks, releasing the command/input and screwing up my intentions.</i></p>

<p>This Tomb Raider control scheme looks very difficult, and the controls (and your hands) are blocking half the screen.</p>

<p>The industry has even created some questionable work-arounds to use joysticks on mobile:</p>

<h2>Our Platformer, Inputs V1:</h2>

<p>This game was created by Dion Larson, a <a target="_blank" href="http://ajs.design/makegameswithus/">MakeGamesWithUs Summer Academy</a> student developer; he was so good the company (now Make School) hired him.</p>

<br><br>

<p>As you can see in the video, our first iteration used a left joystick for movement and a right button for jumping. With all the evidence that this was "doing it wrong", we set out to upgrade the control system with touchscreen gestures.</p>

<p>One quick side-note: generally, portrait orientated games work great for mobile because they can be playable with one hand (both holding the device and controlling the game). While I think Catburz could work well in portrait, that was a stretch goal - we at least wanted the controls to be one-handed.</p>

<p>Another quick side-note: this game had Braid-like rewind capability/gameplay. See this in action at 2:10 in the video. The rewind was controlled by tilting the phone with input sensed by device's accelerometer. It was super cool! Check out the final version of the animation we used to teach players this mechanic.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Platformer Input V2:</h2>

<p>First we outlined overall control requirements:</p>

<p>The character (Catburz) needs to:</p>
<p>
1. move left / right<br>
2. climb ladders up / down (note: character can not jump off of ladders)<br>
3. jump<br>
4. stop<br>
</p>

<p>Our first solution, in the same order of the above requirements:</p>

<p>
1. swipe left / swipe right<br>
2. swipe up (when character is overlapping a ladder) / swipe down (when character is overlapping or standing on top of a ladder)<br>
3. swipe up (if not overlapping a ladder)<br>
4. swipe in the opposite direction that character is moving<br>
</p>

<p>We coded and tested this. It worked pretty well except for #4 which turned out to be just plain un-intuitive and bad.</p>

<p>For instance, if the character was moving in the air and the player wanted to change direction, the player would have to swipe twice to achieve the directional change...this screwed up gameplay: the character would first stop, then fall, then move on the second swipe. It felt terrible and in retrospect was just not going to work with this game.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Catburz input V3 (final):</h2>

<p>4. We changed the “stop” command to a single tap. This worked great! Everyone who tested it was totally hooked.</p>

<p>2-3. The only issue we found was: what happens when the character is at the base of a ladder and would like to jump? The up-swipe action would cause the player to climb the ladder. Sometimes in design you make compromises and this was one of those cases. We decided to add these parameters: if a player was moving over a ladder and swiped up, the character would jump, and so a player would need to stop at the base of a ladder to swipe up and climb up the ladder. This type of change may effect level design as it takes slightly longer for a player to climb a ladder (2 gestures instead of 1).</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Whenever designing games for touchscreen mobile devices, one should strive to make "native" (commonly understood / standardized) touchscreen inputs, like swiping and tapping.</p>

<p>The greater conclusion is to build games for touchscreen mobile devices that work best on the platform. While I think a platformer game like Catburz can be great on mobile, maybe sticking to games that require very simple control schemes (like an endless runner) are most appropriate. In that respect, it's no wonder why simple games like Flappy Bird and, one of my favorites, Pancake do so well.</p>
